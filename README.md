## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the development server.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

---

### `npm run build`

Bundles the app into static files for production.  
It optimizes the build for the best performance.

---

### `npm test`

Starts the test runner to test your app logic and components.

---

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!  
It removes the toolchain abstraction and copies all build dependencies, configuration files, and scripts to your project directory.

---

> ⚠️ This command is not commonly used unless you need full control over the build setup.

---

### 📦 `package.json`

The `package.json` file contains all metadata, project info, and dependencies needed to run and build your app.  
Everything you've seen above is defined and configured inside it.
